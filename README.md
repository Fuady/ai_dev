# This repo is for ai-dev-tools course from DataTalksClubs

## Module 1: Intro to Vibe Coding

This module introduces participants to modern AI development tooling, showing how different categories of tools can enhance developer's experience.

- Chat Applications: great for exploration and brainstorming, but less convenient for iterative development.
- Coding Assistants / IDE Integrations: help write, refactor, and test code directly inside development environments.
- Project Bootstrappers: generate starter projects quickly from natural language prompts.
- Agents: more advanced systems that can operate across files, perform tool-based actions, and automate workflows.
- Create a snake game based on react using Chatgpt and Cloude
- Export all folders to Github

## Module 2: End-to-end

- create frontend with loveable.dev
